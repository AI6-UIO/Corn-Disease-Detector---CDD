# Information

This is the repository for Corn Disease Detector (CDD), a deep learning project built 
during the Saturdays AI Quito 2021 artificial intelligence course. We are Team 7. 
Here you will find a github page describing the project and how we built our model. 
To replicate out work, please download PlantVillage Database, divide the dataset for 
corn into *test, validation and training* sets, as is explained in our [`jupyter notebook`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IJNLBUoJIQpNhsha8eOib3POjOzjsd1M/view?usp=sharing).
